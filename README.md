 ### Agenda
  * **Prerequisites & first step (to create an ng app)**
    * npm oooobviously
    * @angular/cli
  * Components
  * Data & event binding
  * Directives (very small talk)
  * Routing
  * Services
  * Deploying
  -------------------------------
  ## Prerequisites
  We only need `npm` (NodeJs comes implicitly) and `@angular/cli` and that should be enough so let's type
  `npm i -g @angular/cli`

 ## The first steps (create a ng app) 
 With our just recently added friend `@angular/cli` we are just going to type in console
 ```shell
 ng new <appName>
 # other good options to start over
 ng new <appname> --style=scss --routing
 # it oviusly set scss for style instead of css and also 
 #Â enables the routing
 ```
 Once done just go and do `ng serve` and once it finishes
 > Just go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
 > *type* `ng` *to see more options*
