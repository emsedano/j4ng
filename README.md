# j4Ng

 ## Agenda
  * Prerequisites & first step (to create an ng app)
    * npm ooooviously
    * @angular/cli
  * Components
    * `it is` for small
  * Directives
    * Structural vs element
  

  # Prerequisites
  We only need `npm` (NodeJs implicitly) and `@angular/cli` and that should be enough so let's type
  `npm i -g @angular/cli`

 # The first step (create a ng app) 
 With out just recent added frien `@angular/cli` we are just going to type in console
 ```shell
 ng new <appName>
 # other good options to start over
 ng new <appname> --style=scss --routing
 # it oviusly set scss for style instead of css and also 
 #Â enables the routing
 ```
 Once done just go and do `ng serve` and once it finishes
 > Just go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
